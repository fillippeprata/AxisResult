# Why AxisResult? · comparison

> There are other Result libraries for C#. This page tells you why AxisResult is different — a direct comparison, no hand-waving.

## vs. FluentResults

FluentResults is popular but limited. It lacks monadic composition — you can't chain async operations without manual unwrapping. There's no `ValueTask` support, no tuple composition, no recovery patterns, and no typed error categories. It's a container, not a railway.

## vs. ErrorOr

ErrorOr offers basic chaining but misses the depth needed for production systems. No `ValueTask` variants, no `Zip` for combining independent operations, no `Recover`/`RecoverWhen` for conditional fallbacks, no `RequireNotFound` for idempotent creation patterns.

## vs. LanguageExt

LanguageExt is a 7.5MB functional programming framework. If you only need Result types, you're pulling in immutable collections, State monads, Reader monads, and an entirely non-idiomatic API. AxisResult gives you the composition power without the weight or the learning curve.

## vs. CSharpFunctionalExtensions

Solid library, but no `ValueTask` support, no `Zip`, no typed error categories, no recovery patterns, no parallel aggregation. It's good for basic Result patterns but falls short in complex domain scenarios.

## vs. Ardalis.Result

Designed for ASP.NET controllers, not for domain logic. Basic `Map`/`Bind` support, no composition depth, no async variants, no recovery. Great for HTTP response mapping, limited everywhere else.
